This repository contains a Java program that exhibits an uncommon coding error involving unexpected loop termination. The program demonstrates how a seemingly simple `if` condition inside a loop can lead to the loop ending earlier than expected, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the program. The `UncommonBug.java` file contains the buggy code, while `UncommonBugSolution.java` offers a refined solution.
